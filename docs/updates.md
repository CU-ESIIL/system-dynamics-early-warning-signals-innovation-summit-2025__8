# Updates & Milestones

Capture quick daily notes so we can track progress across the sprint. Short
bullet lists are perfect—focus on decisions, roadblocks, and visuals that are
ready to share.

## Day 1 — Framing the challenge
- _Add a sentence about the system you are modeling and the questions you framed._
- _Link to any whiteboard photos or sketches you uploaded._

## Day 2 — Building and testing
- _Summarize the datasets explored and the indicators you prototyped._
- _Note any unexpected behaviors or model tuning steps._

## Day 3 — Sharing insights
- _Capture headline findings and the visuals you plan to present._
- _List follow-up tasks or owners for post-summit work._

Add additional days or sections if the project continues beyond the summit.
