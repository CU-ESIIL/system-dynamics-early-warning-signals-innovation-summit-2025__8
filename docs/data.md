# Data & Access

Use this page to track datasets, portals, and access instructions that support
our system dynamics modeling work. Link to the original source whenever
possible and include notes about licensing or sharing constraints.

## Team storage

- **CyVerse community folder:** [Innovation Summit â†’ Group 8](https://de.cyverse.org/data/ds/iplant/home/shared/esiil/Innovation_summit/Group_8)
- Organize shared assets into subfolders such as `shared_data/`, `intermediate/`,
  and `outputs/` so everyone knows where to look.

## Candidate data streams

| Dataset | Source & link | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Early warning indicator catalog | _Add link_ | Potential leading indicators for regime shifts. |
| System structure inventories | _Add link_ | Stocks, flows, and feedbacks to parameterize models. |
| Scenario or policy drivers | _Add link_ | External forcing that influences resilience thresholds. |

## Access checklist

- [ ] Document who requested access or download permissions.
- [ ] Record preprocessing steps in `documentation/` or alongside code.
- [ ] Flag sensitive or restricted data and describe how to handle it safely.

Add new rows or sections as you identify additional datasets during the sprint.
